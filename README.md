# Summer Research Projects - 2020


* ## Project 1:  Rib Fracture Detection and Classification

This is a part of [MICCAI 2020 RibFrac Challenge:](https://ribfrac.grand-challenge.org/overview)

Diagnosis of rib fractures serves as an important and common task in clinical practice, forensics and several business scenarios (e.g., insurance claims). However, few prior studies investigate automatic machine learning techniques on this labor-intensive task. This challenge establishes a large-scale benchmark dataset to automatically detect and classify around 5,000 rib fractures from 660 computed tomography (CT) scans, which consists of 420 training CTs (all with fractures), 80 validation CTs (20 without fractures) and 160 evaluation CTs. Each annotation consists of a pixel-level mask of rib fracture regions (for serving detection), plus a 4-type classification. Both detection and classification tasks are involved in this challenge. An algorithmic challenge for rib fracture detection and classification is the elongated object shape. We hope this challenge could facilitate the research and application of automatic rib fracture detection and diagnoses.

* ## Project 2: Green Space Classification

The aims of this project is to 1) develop a machine learning model that can reliably and efficiently classify the type of vegetation (e.g. grass, shrub/bush, tree) based on high resolution image data; and 2) apply the model to estimate vegetation types in two different study areas (i.e. southern California and Beijing, China) and examine exposure to green space in relation to sociodemographic factors (e.g. age, education, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity) at small integrated spatial units (e.g. Census block in the U.S. and Jiedao or Zhen in China).  In the near future, the model will also be applied to estimate green space exposure of subjects in two epidemiological studies, one in southern California and one in China.  We will examine the associations of pregnant women's exposure to green space with their physical activity levels and pregnancy outcomes, e.g. pregnancy complication, preterm birth, and low birth weight.  Previously most such epidemiological studies relied on satellite-derived green space measure, such as Normalized difference vegetation index.  However, such measures did not specify the type of vegetation, which would affect people's physical activity, the effectiveness of stress reduction/cognitive restoration, the reduction of air pollution/noise/heat etc.  In addition, green space seen from the satellite is well above the top of the space, which is different from the angel what human eyes see.  Thus, we think it is important to develop a model that can differentiate the type of vegetation based on ground-level image data.

We have annotated Google Street View and Baidu Street View images of about 1300 scenes that cover both Beijing and southern California.   These annotated images will be used in model training and validation.  Previously an undergraduate student trained an efficient neural network (ENet) model with about 150 images.  The results are reasonably good although no extensive validation has been conducted.  In the summer of 2020, we would like to compare a few other machine learning models and pick a model with the best performance and is reasonably efficient.  We will also train the model with many more images.  We plan to draft paper focusing on the two aims  by the end of this summer.
